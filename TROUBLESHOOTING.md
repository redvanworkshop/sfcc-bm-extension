**SOLUTION:** Make sure you have either [VS Code w/ Prophet Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SqrTT.prophet) or [Eclipse w/ UX Studio](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.demandware.dochelp%2FSiteDevelopment%2FInstallUXStudio.html) running, with your SFCC project opened.  Once you've opened your SFCC project, re-clicking the button should correctly open the file.
